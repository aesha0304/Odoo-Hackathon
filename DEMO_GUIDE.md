## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If the app doesn't load:
1. Check if both servers are running:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3001  # Backend
   lsof -i :5173  # Frontend
   ```

2. Restart servers if needed:
   ```bash
   # Kill existing processes
   pkill -f "node server.js"
   pkill -f "vite"
   
   # Restart backend
   cd server && node server.js &
   
   # Restart frontend
   cd client && npm run dev &
   ```

### If API calls fail:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the proxy configuration in `client/vite.config.js`
- Ensure backend is running on port 3001

## üìù Notes

- **Data Persistence**: Currently using in-memory storage, so data will be lost when you restart the server
- **Authentication**: Simple token-based auth (not production-ready)
- **Mock Data**: Pre-populated with 3 users (Sarah, Mike, Emma)
- **Real-time**: No real-time updates (would need WebSocket implementation)
